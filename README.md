# SpaceX-Falcon-9-First-Stage-Landing-Prediction
This repository predicts if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX reduces launch costs to 62 million dollars by reusing the first stage, while others charge over 165 million. Predicting landings helps assess costs and informs competitive bids against SpaceX.

The project is divided between multiple notebooks, with work ranging from data collection - to cleaning - ML prediction. Please refer to each notebook for more details. For your reference:
  - 1. Data Collection through API
    2. Web Scraping - More Data Collection
    3. Data Wrangling
    4. Exploratory Data Analysis
    5. Preparing the data
    6. Visual Analysis with Folium
    7. Machine Learning Prediction
